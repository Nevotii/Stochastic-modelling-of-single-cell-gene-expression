# Stochastic modelling of single cell gene expression
A simple Markov Chain (MC) model for stochastic simulations of gene expression. 
The code includes implementations for: 
1. Gillespie algorithm 
2. Solving moments ODEs derived from the Chemical Master Equation (CME)
3. Bayesian inference of parameters with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC method)
